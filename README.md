## Deployment
The front-end of our application uses ReactJS as our library. The front-end follows the best practice in naming the components to be semantic. The front-end composes the following technologies/platforms:

### Vercel:
Vercel is the most accessible platform to deploy websites. By connecting the ** your GitHub repository** to Vercel, you can simply deploy the main branch to Vercel domains â€” and it does all the heavy lifting for you. **(Julian Wallis)**
