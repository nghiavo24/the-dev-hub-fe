## Project Overview
The Dev Hub was created for people who need a little extra help with finding and tracking which jobs they have applied for. The Dev Hub allows you to sign in and add the jobs you have applied for, you can then view all the companies you have applied for, when you applied and which position you applied to. You are able to add notes, to help stay organized! There is also an option for users to add job postings they have seen, but don't necessarily want to apply to. That feature is there so you can see what others are posting, to feel supported but also get the opportunity to give support!

## Deployment
The front-end of our application uses ReactJS as our library. The front-end follows the best practice in naming the components to be semantic. The front-end composes the following technologies/platforms:

### Vercel:
Vercel is the most accessible platform to deploy websites. By connecting the ** your GitHub repository** to Vercel, you can simply deploy the main branch to Vercel domains â€” and it does all the heavy lifting for you. **(Julian Wallis)**

## Post MVP
-We can add a filter feature, so the user can filter all the applications or postings.
-We can also an help page on each of the create pages, to help make user experience better. 
-We can also add alerts to each input box, so the user will know if they missed something when trying to create a posting or application.

- Add an option to set reminders for interviews
- Add the option to be able to apply from the website and not have to go to an external page
- Add the option to alphabetically sort your Jobs or Applications
- Add the option to sort by any field
- Re-design the logged-in/logged-out pop-up

## Issues & Resolutions
We had the opportunity to learn Tailwind.css in this project, though it was fun it did come with some challenges. It was mainly time consuming when it came to styling because it is a new syntax we had to learn and had to go back and forth to different resources to get it right. But the more we added the easier and faster styling became!
We did have an issue with the date not displaying as we were intending it to, we fixed it but it then broke again unfortunately. But after several hours of different sets of eyes looking at it and reading through different documents... we put it to the side. But after much time the team attended office hours and we were able to work with our TAs to get the date displayed properly.
